# Public Cloud Demo

## Multilevel

The [multilevel](multilevel) section demonstrates how to decouple infrastructure modeling from application modeling,
by blueprinting both separately, and connecting between them during application deployment time.

## Plugins

The [plugins](plugins) section contains plugins used throughout the demo. You should package them as Wagons
and upload them to Cloudify Manager before proceeding.
